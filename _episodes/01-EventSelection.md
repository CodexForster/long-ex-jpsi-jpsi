# Goal of this exercise

The overall purpose of this exercise is to provide you with a basic understanding of a physical analysis and the opportunity to participate in it . Considering that we need to compress an analysis that has taken several years into a few days of exercise, we need to capture as many of the key aspects as possible. We will provide you with examples of some of the procedures to help you understand them. And for some of the procedures that are time-consuming because of large data, you will only need to be able to run through them with a small amount of data, and we will provide you with pre-prepared data for the next step. If you have any questions about the exercise, please feel free to ask. If you have better insights or ways to any part, please feel free to do that as well. It is sincere hope that we all get a lot out of this exercise!

# Introduction

This exercise looks for possible tetraquark candidates that decays into double J/ψ, and each J/ψ decays in dimouns. We will learn how to reconstruct double Jψ events from raw data, and how to estimate background from MC and data itself. An important aspect of this analysis is that we will learn how to identify multiple new structures from background events step by step. Another important aspect of this analysis is to employ maximum likelihood fit in the mass distribution.
